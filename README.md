## riscV calculator
This is a projec I worked on in a computer architecture class during my sophomore year at Kyungpook National University.<br>
To run this program you"ll need a RISC-V Assembler and Runtime Simulator.<br>
You can download it [here](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars)<br>
Once installed, open the calculator file in the assebler and enter the mathematical expressions that you'd like to compute.<br>
